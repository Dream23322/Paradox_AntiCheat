## How do I set my OP password?

!> Paradox v5.0.0 doesn't have a configuration file as this is all handled in game. By default all modules are disabled. If a module is required you must enabled it.

Simply import the pack into your world and load in. Type `!op`, and a UI will pop up asking you to set a new password. Paradox has various levels of clearance; currently, you will have a clearance value of 4, which is the highest. We will cover this in more detail here.
