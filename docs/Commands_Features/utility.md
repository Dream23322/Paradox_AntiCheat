### At A Glance

The !pvp command provides players with control over Player vs. Player (PvP) settings. Users can toggle their own PvP mode, enable or disable PvP globally across the server, or check the current PvP status.

### How It Works

The PvP management system handles PvP status, cooldowns, and punishments for players who log out during PvP. It listens to events like entity hits, effects added, and player spawns or logouts. When a player attacks another, it checks if PvP is enabled, manages health adjustments to prevent unfair attacks, and starts a cooldown period preventing logout. If a player logs out during the cooldown, they are marked for punishment, which includes inventory loss. Upon rejoining, punished players receive an alert and have their inventory cleared.
